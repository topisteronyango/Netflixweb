This is the official repository for the National Health Intergrated System.

You can access the National Health Integrated System through NHIS.APP

The National Health Integrated System is a Web Project which combines Azure App Services, Azure SQL Database and a host of other Azure technologies to bring an end to the fragmented and disjointed healthcare system that currently exists in our country. The current system is inefficient, with a lack of information sharing between healthcare facilities leading to duplicated efforts, increased costs, and potential health risks for patients.

The goal of this project is to create a centralized and integrated healthcare management system that can be used by all hospitals across the country. The system will bring together critical patient information, such as medical history, lab results and prescribed medications, and make it accessible to authorized healthcare providers in real-time. This will eliminate the need for paper records and ensure that medical professionals have access to complete and up-to-date information, regardless of where a patient has received treatment in the past.
